Pre-work - Basic Calculator

Basic Calculator is a simple web application built using JavaScript to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It was created as part of a learning project and submitted for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Moises Rendiles

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

Features

The following required functionality is complete:

 Calculator interface displays digits 0-9 and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
 Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
 Calculator displays the result of the current calculation.
 Users can clear the input and start a new calculation.

     Error handling for invalid inputs or operations.

The following optional features are implemented:

 Users can perform additional operations (e.g., square root, percentage).
 Calculator has a responsive design and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
 Users can see a history of their calculations.
 Calculator supports keyboard input for numbers and operators.

     Users can customize the calculator theme or appearance.

Reflection Questions

Outside Resources:
I referred to the MDN Web Docs and online JavaScript forums to troubleshoot
specific issues related to JavaScript syntax and handling user input.

Challenges Faced:
One challenge I encountered was implementing error handling for invalid inputs and
operations. I overcame this challenge by researching regular expressions to
validate user input and providing clear error messages to guide users when they
enter invalid expressions.

Questions about Web Development:
After completing this submission, I'm interested in learning more about advanced
JavaScript concepts, such as closures and asynchronous programming. I also have
questions about optimizing web applications for performance and best practices
for deploying web projects.

Additional Work:
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would focus on
implementing error handling to ensure the calculator provides informative error
messages for various scenarios. I would also enhance the user interface by adding
animations for button clicks and transitions between different states of the
calculator. Additionally, I would explore integrating keyboard shortcuts for power
users who prefer using the keyboard for calculations.
